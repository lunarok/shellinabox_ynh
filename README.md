  Yunohost App to add Shellinabox

**Status** : The app can be used, it's working. But will not automaticly install Shellinabox, you must have a functionnal Shellinabox before (on the Yunhost server or other server)

It's creating a reverse proxy configuration. Find information on Yunohost wiki for installation/configuration of Shellinabox to work behind a Reverse Proxy

**TODO : install Shellinabox if the server choosen is localhost**
